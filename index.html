              I'm Navin Gharti, currently pursuing Computer Programming at
              Niagara College Toronto. I have a deep passion for coding and
              problem-solving, and I'm always eager to learn new technologies.
              With a strong foundation in web development and programming, I
              enjoy working on front-end projects that focus on creating
              user-friendly, visually appealing designs. I believe that
              continuous learning and hands-on experience are key to staying
              ahead in the fast-evolving tech industry.
            </p>
            <p class="text-mute">
              At 20, I'm driven by the desire to build impactful software
              solutions and contribute to innovative projects. I constantly seek
              opportunities to grow, whether through coding challenges,
              collaborating on open-source projects, or expanding my knowledge
              in back-end technologies. My goal is to become a well-rounded
              developer who can seamlessly navigate both the front-end and
              back-end, bringing ideas to life through code.
